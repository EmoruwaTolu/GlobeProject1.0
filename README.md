# GlobeProject1.0
This is an unfinished project that focuses on spreading awareness for the earth. It has not been optimized for use on smaller devices such as phones. So any changes in screen/viewport size might create a less than ideal experience. The 7 billion people section of the project is meant to fetch an API from a website but that hasn't been done yet and the animated earth that would be on the hero with the title,"It's your earth it's time to save it", isn't done yet
